# Profits or Losses? Expected Value From Soccer Betting

If I always bet on the favorite team, would I win or lose money?
What if I bet on the second favorite or the least favorite?

In this project, the expected value from soccer betting is discussed. The purpose is to show how good the bookies are at assigning odds to soccer events in order to ensure profits.

This work is informative to the public who wants to know how casinos make money and what is behind the saying: 'The House always wins'.

The data used in this project were obtained from https://www.football-data.co.uk/ and contain information about past soccer games from some of the european leagues, including results and odds. If you want to know more about the data, visit the site.
